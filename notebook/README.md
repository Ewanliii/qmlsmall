# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used during the experimental development
and analysis process of the paper.

These notebooks are provided for transparency and illustration purposes.
All final, reproducible implementations are available as standalone Python scripts
under the `src/` directory.

## Overview

- `DAE_trainer.ipynb`  
  Exploratory notebook for training and validating the denoising autoencoder (DAE),
  including sanity checks and intermediate diagnostics.

- `ml_work.ipynb`  
  Experimental notebook for classical machine learning baselines
  (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP).

- `VQC_work.ipynb`  
  Experimental notebook for variational quantum circuit (VQC) models
  and architecture variants.

- `drawplot.ipynb`  
  Notebook used for plotting and visualizing experimental results
  (figures included in the paper).

## Notes

- Notebooks may contain exploratory code and intermediate outputs.
- For reproducible experiments and clean execution, please refer to the scripts in `src/`.
